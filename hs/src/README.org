  non-deterministic computation
      The kind of computation that, instead of
      producing a single result, might produce
      many.

      A computation returning a non-
      deterministic result of type a is not a
      pure function, but it can be made into one
      by transforming its result type from a to
      a list of a.
      
      In essence, we create a function that
      returns all possible results at once.
